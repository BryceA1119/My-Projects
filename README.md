```I asked ChatGPT to write me a puzzle game in Lua for Pico 8 and the image above shows the initial state of the game. The goal is to push the orange blocks to the green squares or the target spots and once all are in the correct spot you will win the level. I kept adding levels to the game while increasing the complexity as you progessed such as ading more blocks or traps such as pitfalls.```

```Here is another game that I made with the help of ChatGPT which is a fantasy game where you have to fend off hordes of enemies while trying to avoid your health from dropping below zero. The game functioned well dispite some minor flaws, the only problem was that there was not a specific end to the game so the waves of enemies just kept coming. ```

```The final game that I was working on with ChatGPT was a first person shooter based off of doom. I was able to make good progess with the raytracing, but I had continuing struggles with getting the game fully functional. Through my research I was able to get a better idea of the limitations of LLMs and the creation of games, which not to my surprise was very lacking and shows that dispite how far AI has come, it still has a long way to go to be able to create fully fledged games.```
